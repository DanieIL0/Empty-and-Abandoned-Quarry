# Empty-and-Abandoned-Quarry
This satirical C program (using SIMD) simulates Kafkaesque German bureaucracy. Memory blocks are inexplicably "arrested" while lazy bureaucrat threads fill in pointless forms and take endless breaks, gobbling up RAM like free coffee. Eventually it all breaks down, so the only solution is to call the Amt again... good luck!
