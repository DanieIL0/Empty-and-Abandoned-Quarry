#**The Trial: Memory Eater:**

Ever called the government for hours on hold only to have them not answer or tell you to call back tomorrow? Ever waited 1 month for a passport but ended up waiting 3 months and almost couldn't go abroad? Ever not told the authorities that you moved and got letters forever? Welcome to the most Kafkaesque, trial-inspired program ever written in pure C. Created out of sheer frustration with German bureaucracy (it was bad with me, but with my Ukrainian relatives I really can't stand it anymore) and to show off freshly learned systems programming skills, this program simulates pointless paperwork through pointless memory allocations. Don't worry the Amt is almost done!

### What it does:
- Immediately arrests your memory (for no apparent reason).
- Constantly fills in forms that nobody asked for.
- Each form contains super-important fields (ever wondered about the emotional state of your rubber stamp?).
- Bureaucrats (Threads) shuffle these forms around, mostly doing nothing, occasionally sharpening pencils or discussing paper clips.
- Memory Management ("Authority") releases memory based on lunar phases, stock markets, and very completely logical logic.
- An Advocate thread begs for mercy-always denied (did you notarize Form 34B-ඞ-§7? No? Too bad).
- Finally, the program eats all your memory and crashes spectacularly, every time, so weird, let's try again, maybe next time it will work.

### Features nobody asked for**:
- SIMD instructions used exclusively for useless computations, but making them insanely optimized.
- Unsolvable circular deadlocks that mimic real bureaucratic nightmares.
- Random bureaucratic excuses printed with alarming regularity.

### Warning:
- This program *will* crash your system by exhausting memory.
- There is no escape, only acceptance.

Enjoy the absurdity, and remember:  
"Someone must have slandered K., because without doing anything wrong, the memory was arrested one morning."

**Happy paperwork!**
